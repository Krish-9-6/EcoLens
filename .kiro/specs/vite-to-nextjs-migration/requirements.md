# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing EcoLens React application from a Vite-based architecture to a modern Next.js 14+ application. The migration will modernize the build system, introduce server-side rendering capabilities, and leverage Next.js App Router for improved performance and developer experience. The refactored application will maintain all existing functionality while gaining the benefits of Next.js's full-stack capabilities and Turbopack for faster development builds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Vite to Next.js 14+ with App Router, so that I can leverage server-side rendering, improved performance, and modern React patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Next.js 14+ as the primary framework
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use the App Router architecture instead of Pages Router
3. WHEN running in development THEN the application SHALL use Turbopack for faster build times
4. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL generate optimized static and server-side rendered pages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing functionality during migration, so that no features are lost in the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing React components SHALL function identically
2. WHEN the counter button is clicked THEN it SHALL increment the count as before
3. WHEN the page loads THEN all logos and static content SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN styles are applied THEN the visual appearance SHALL match the original application

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modernize the styling approach, so that I can use Tailwind CSS for better maintainability and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Tailwind CSS instead of vanilla CSS
2. WHEN components are styled THEN they SHALL use Tailwind utility classes
3. WHEN the application loads THEN all visual styling SHALL be preserved or improved
4. WHEN custom styles are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented using Tailwind's configuration system

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly separate Server and Client Components, so that I can optimize performance and follow Next.js best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are static THEN they SHALL be implemented as Server Components
2. WHEN components require interactivity THEN they SHALL be implemented as Client Components with "use client" directive
3. WHEN the page renders THEN Server Components SHALL be rendered on the server
4. WHEN interactive features are used THEN Client Components SHALL handle user interactions properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize asset handling, so that images and static files are served efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
2. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be properly cached and optimized
3. WHEN the application loads THEN all assets from the original public and src/assets directories SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN favicon is displayed THEN it SHALL be properly configured in the root layout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain development tooling and configuration, so that the development experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN it SHALL include TypeScript configuration
2. WHEN code is linted THEN it SHALL use ESLint with Next.js specific rules
3. WHEN the development server runs THEN it SHALL support hot module replacement
4. WHEN VS Code and Kiro configurations exist THEN they SHALL be preserved from the original project

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the project structure follows Next.js conventions, so that it's maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL use the src/ directory pattern
2. WHEN pages are created THEN they SHALL follow App Router file conventions
3. WHEN components are organized THEN they SHALL be placed in appropriate directories
4. WHEN the root layout is configured THEN it SHALL properly handle global styles and metadata
