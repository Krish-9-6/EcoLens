# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Brand Dashboard is the core authenticated experience for brand users in the Veritas platform. This B2B engine enables brand managers to securely create and manage their products while mapping their multi-tier supply chain relationships. The system must provide complete data isolation between brands through a secure, multi-tenant architecture, ensuring each brand can only access and modify their own data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Management

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want to create and manage my company's products, so that I can establish the foundation for supply chain mapping and digital product passports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a brand manager accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display only products belonging to their brand
2. WHEN a brand manager creates a new product THEN the system SHALL validate the product name is at least 3 characters
3. WHEN a product is successfully created THEN the system SHALL automatically associate it with the authenticated user's brand_id
4. WHEN a brand manager views their products THEN the system SHALL display them in a table format with navigation to detailed views
5. IF a brand manager attempts to access another brand's product THEN the system SHALL deny access through row-level security

### Requirement 2: Multi-Tier Supply Chain Mapping

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want to add and link suppliers across multiple tiers (1, 2, and 3) to specific products, so that I can create a comprehensive supply chain map for transparency and compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a supplier THEN the system SHALL require name, tier (1-3), and location fields
2. WHEN creating a Tier 1 supplier THEN the system SHALL set parent_supplier_id to NULL
3. WHEN creating a Tier 2 or 3 supplier THEN the system SHALL require a valid parent_supplier_id from the previous tier
4. WHEN viewing a product's supply chain THEN the system SHALL display suppliers organized by tier in separate visual columns
5. WHEN a supplier is added THEN the system SHALL create entries in both suppliers and product_suppliers tables
6. IF a supplier tier is invalid (not 1, 2, or 3) THEN the system SHALL reject the submission with validation errors

### Requirement 3: Data Security and Multi-Tenancy

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want my company's data to be completely isolated from other brands, so that I can trust the platform with sensitive supply chain information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database operation occurs THEN the system SHALL enforce row-level security policies
2. WHEN a user queries products THEN the system SHALL only return products where brand_id matches the user's brand_id
3. WHEN a user queries suppliers THEN the system SHALL only return suppliers where brand_id matches the user's brand_id
4. WHEN inserting new data THEN the system SHALL automatically set brand_id to the authenticated user's brand_id
5. IF a user attempts to modify data from another brand THEN the system SHALL block the operation at the database level

### Requirement 4: Form Validation and User Experience

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want immediate feedback on form inputs and clear error messages, so that I can efficiently enter data without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering form data THEN the system SHALL provide client-side validation using Zod schemas
2. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each invalid field
3. WHEN submitting forms THEN the system SHALL show loading states to indicate processing
4. WHEN server-side validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error messages
5. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL display success messages and refresh relevant data

### Requirement 5: Integration with Digital Product Passport

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want my product and supply chain data to be accessible for public digital product passports, so that consumers can verify product authenticity and sustainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN product and supplier data is created THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility with existing DPP data structures
2. WHEN DPP pages are accessed publicly THEN the system SHALL allow read-only access to products and suppliers through public RLS policies
3. WHEN database schema changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing DPP functionality
4. WHEN TypeScript types are regenerated THEN the system SHALL ensure DPP components continue to function without type errors
5. IF DPP data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error handling and fallback states

### Requirement 6: Navigation and Dashboard Structure

**User Story:** As a brand manager, I want intuitive navigation between products and their detailed supply chain views, so that I can efficiently manage multiple products and their complex supplier relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a main products listing page
2. WHEN clicking on a product THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed product page showing supply chain
3. WHEN on a product detail page THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy for Tier 1, 2, and 3 suppliers
4. WHEN adding suppliers THEN the system SHALL provide contextual forms based on the selected tier and parent supplier
5. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the UI without requiring manual page reload
